# Quick Start

This guide will help you quickly set up Typper Figma Plugin Deploy to automate your Figma plugin deployment.

## Initial Setup

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

Make sure your Figma plugin project is in a GitHub repository and has a valid `manifest.json` file.

### 2. Configure Secrets

In your GitHub repository, go to Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions and add the following secrets:

```bash
FIGMA_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
FIGMA_PASSWORD=your-figma-password
FIGMA_TOTP_SECRET=your-totp-secret
```

<Note>
  The TOTP secret is required for two-factor authentication. See the
  [Authentication](/guides/authentication) guide for more details.
</Note>

### 3. Create the Workflow

Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file in your repository with the following content:

```yaml
name: Deploy Figma Plugin
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Deploy Figma Plugin
        uses: typper-io/figma-plugin-deploy@v1
        with:
          plugin-id: "your-plugin-id"
          team-id: "your-team-id"
          release-notes: "New version"
        env:
          FIGMA_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_EMAIL }}
          FIGMA_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_PASSWORD }}
          FIGMA_TOTP_SECRET: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_TOTP_SECRET }}
```

<Note>
  Replace `your-plugin-id` and `your-team-id` with your actual Figma plugin and
  team IDs.
</Note>

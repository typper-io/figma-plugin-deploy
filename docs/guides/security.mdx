# Security Best Practices

Security is crucial when automating your Figma plugin deployment. This guide covers best practices to keep your deployment process secure.

## Credential Management

### GitHub Secrets

Always store sensitive information in GitHub Secrets:

- `FIGMA_EMAIL`
- `FIGMA_PASSWORD`
- `FIGMA_TOTP_SECRET`

<Warning>
  Never store these credentials in your repository files or expose them in logs.
</Warning>

### Access Control

1. **Repository Access**

   - Limit repository access to necessary team members
   - Use repository roles to control permissions
   - Regularly audit repository access

2. **Workflow Permissions**
   - Configure minimal required permissions for workflows
   - Use environment protection rules
   - Enable required reviewers for protected environments

## Environment Configuration

### Environment Protection

Set up protected environments in GitHub:

1. Go to Repository Settings > Environments
2. Create environments (e.g., staging, production)
3. Configure protection rules:
   - Required reviewers
   - Wait timer
   - Deployment branches

Example environment configuration:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Production
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*"

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # ... deployment steps
```

### Secret Rotation

Implement regular credential rotation:

1. Generate new credentials periodically
2. Update GitHub Secrets
3. Verify deployment after updates
4. Remove old credentials

## Secure Workflow Practices

### Input Validation

Validate all inputs in your workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Validate Inputs
        run: |
          if [[ ! ${{ github.ref }} =~ ^refs/tags/v ]]; then
            echo "Invalid tag format"
            exit 1
          fi
```

### Dependency Security

1. **Action Versions**
   - Pin action versions using SHA
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Monitor security advisories

Example of pinned actions:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@8ade135a41bc03ea155e62e844d188df1ea18608 # v4
  - uses: actions/setup-node@b39b52d1213e96004bfcb1c61a8a6fa8ab84f3e8 # v4
```

2. **Dependency Scanning**
   - Use GitHub's dependency scanning
   - Implement automated security updates
   - Review dependency changes

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Workflow Logs

Monitor workflow execution:

1. Review workflow logs regularly
2. Set up notifications for failures
3. Monitor unusual patterns
4. Configure log retention policies

### Audit Trail

Maintain deployment records:

1. Use detailed commit messages
2. Tag releases properly
3. Document deployment issues
4. Keep change logs updated

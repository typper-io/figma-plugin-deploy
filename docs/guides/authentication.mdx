# Authentication with Figma

Typper Figma Plugin Deploy requires secure authentication with your Figma account. This guide explains how to properly set up your credentials.

## Authentication Requirements

To publish plugins to Figma, you need:

1. A Figma account with 2FA enabled
2. Administrator permissions for the plugin
3. Access to the team where the plugin is hosted

## Setting up 2FA

### 1. Enable 2FA in Figma

If you haven't enabled 2FA yet:

1. Access your Figma settings
2. Go to the security section
3. Enable two-factor authentication
4. **Important**: During activation, save the TOTP secret code

<Warning>
  If you already have 2FA enabled but didn't save the TOTP secret code, you'll
  need to disable and re-enable 2FA to get a new code.
</Warning>

### 2. Obtain Required Credentials

You'll need three pieces of information:

1. Figma account email
2. Figma account password
3. TOTP secret code (obtained during 2FA activation)

## Configuring Secrets

### In GitHub

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions
3. Add the following secrets:

<CodeGroup>
```bash New Secret
FIGMA_EMAIL
```

```bash New Secret
FIGMA_PASSWORD
```

```bash New Secret
FIGMA_TOTP_SECRET
```

</CodeGroup>

### TOTP Secret Format

The TOTP code must be in base32 format. Example:

```
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ234567
```

<Note>
  The TOTP code is case-sensitive. Make sure to copy it exactly as provided by
  Figma.
</Note>

## Testing Authentication

To verify your credentials are configured correctly:

1. Make a test push to your configured workflow branch
2. Check the logs in the Actions tab
3. Look for any authentication-related error messages

## Troubleshooting

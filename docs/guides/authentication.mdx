# Authentication with Figma

Typper Figma Plugin Deploy requires secure authentication with your Figma account. This guide explains how to properly set up your credentials.

## Authentication Requirements

To publish plugins to Figma, you need:

1. A Figma account with 2FA enabled
2. Administrator permissions for the plugin
3. Access to the team where the plugin is hosted

## Setting up 2FA

### 1. Enable 2FA in Figma

If you haven't enabled 2FA yet:

1. Access your Figma settings
2. Go to the security section
3. Enable two-factor authentication
4. **Important**: During activation, save the TOTP secret code

<Warning>
  If you already have 2FA enabled but didn't save the TOTP secret code, you'll
  need to disable and re-enable 2FA to get a new code.
</Warning>

### 2. Obtain Required Credentials

You'll need three pieces of information:

1. Figma account email
2. Figma account password
3. TOTP secret code (obtained during 2FA activation)

## Configuring Secrets

### In GitHub

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions
3. Add the following secrets:

<CodeGroup>
```bash New Secret
FIGMA_EMAIL
```

```bash New Secret
FIGMA_PASSWORD
```

```bash New Secret
FIGMA_TOTP_SECRET
```

</CodeGroup>

### TOTP Secret Format

The TOTP code must be in base32 format. Example:

```
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ234567
```

<Note>
  The TOTP code is case-sensitive. Make sure to copy it exactly as provided by
  Figma.
</Note>

## Security Best Practices

### Dedicated Publishing Account

We strongly recommend creating a dedicated Figma account for plugin publishing. This approach:

1. **Enhanced Security**

   - Limits access to only plugin-related functionalities
   - Reduces risk of compromising main company/team accounts
   - Provides better control over publishing credentials
   - Simplifies team member transitions

2. **Account Setup**

   - Create a new Figma account with a company email
   - Use a strong, unique password
   - Enable two-factor authentication (required for plugin publishing)
   - Store credentials in a secure password manager

3. **Best Practices**
   - Use this account exclusively for plugin publishing
   - Grant minimal necessary permissions
   - Regularly rotate credentials
   - Document access procedures securely

<Warning>
  Store the dedicated account's credentials using your organization's secret
  management system and never share them through unsecured channels.
</Warning>

### General Security Guidelines

1. Never share your credentials
2. Don't store credentials in repository files
3. Regularly review repository access
4. Monitor account activity regularly

## Testing Authentication

To verify your credentials are configured correctly:

1. Make a test push to your configured workflow branch
2. Check the logs in the Actions tab
3. Look for any authentication-related error messages

# Workflow Setup

Learn how to configure and customize your GitHub Actions workflow for Figma plugin deployment.

## Basic Workflow

The basic workflow configuration looks like this:

```yaml
name: Deploy Figma Plugin
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Deploy Figma Plugin
        uses: typper-io/figma-plugin-deploy@v1
        with:
          plugin-id: "your-plugin-id"
          team-id: "your-team-id"
          release-notes: "New version"
        env:
          FIGMA_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_EMAIL }}
          FIGMA_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_PASSWORD }}
          FIGMA_TOTP_SECRET: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_TOTP_SECRET }}
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Trigger Events

You can customize when the workflow runs:

```yaml
on:
  # On specific tags
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

  # On specific branches
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - release/*

  # Manually through GitHub UI
  workflow_dispatch:
```

### Release Notes from Commit Messages

Use git commit messages for release notes:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Get Release Notes
        id: release-notes
        run: |
          NOTES=$(git log --format=%s $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD)
          echo "notes<<EOF" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "$NOTES" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "EOF" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Deploy Figma Plugin
        uses: typper-io/figma-plugin-deploy@v1
        with:
          plugin-id: "your-plugin-id"
          team-id: "your-team-id"
          release-notes: ${{ steps.release-notes.outputs.notes }}
        env:
          FIGMA_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_EMAIL }}
          FIGMA_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_PASSWORD }}
          FIGMA_TOTP_SECRET: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_TOTP_SECRET }}
```

### Build Steps

If your plugin requires building:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build Plugin
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy Figma Plugin
        uses: typper-io/figma-plugin-deploy@v1
        with:
          plugin-id: "your-plugin-id"
          team-id: "your-team-id"
          release-notes: "New version"
        env:
          FIGMA_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_EMAIL }}
          FIGMA_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_PASSWORD }}
          FIGMA_TOTP_SECRET: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_TOTP_SECRET }}
```

## Environment Variables

You can use different environments for staging and production:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Deploy Figma Plugin
        uses: typper-io/figma-plugin-deploy@v1
        with:
          plugin-id: ${{ vars.FIGMA_PLUGIN_ID }}
          team-id: ${{ vars.FIGMA_TEAM_ID }}
          release-notes: "New version"
        env:
          FIGMA_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_EMAIL }}
          FIGMA_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_PASSWORD }}
          FIGMA_TOTP_SECRET: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_TOTP_SECRET }}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**

   - Use semantic versioning for your releases
   - Tag your releases with version numbers
   - Include meaningful commit messages

2. **Security**

   - Use environment secrets for sensitive data
   - Limit workflow permissions to necessary actions
   - Review workflow logs for sensitive information

3. **Maintenance**
   - Keep action versions up to date
   - Document workflow configurations
   - Test workflow changes in a staging environment

## Troubleshooting
